#### 💢 Free Version:
- Leaving the update with the built in colors!
this means you can use every hex color you would just want to imagine!
P.S > I use https://www.hexcolortool.com/ to get hex colors ❤️ 
- `IP_LOGGER` also supports the Hex Color Update as mentioned above
- i've replaced the linebreaks from `/n` --> `\\n` give it attention because its kind of breaks long messages
- you can now also use `\\n` for linebreaks in embed titles 
- Fixed so using ``n` will do a linebreak
#### 💲 For premium (5$):

- All Changes From the Free Version
- You can now use linebreaks in `IP_LOGGER` plugin's Embed & title

## ✈ My plans
- Improve DATA Collection of `IP_LOGGER` plugin
- Open the source for `IP_LOGGER` plugin
- NOT NEXT VERSION: Open the source code for the whole application (not premium version)
